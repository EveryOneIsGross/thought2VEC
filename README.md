Fear's algorithms, 
shadow’s might,
process text, 
in darkest light.

RAGDAB forms, 
a corpus bright,
embeddings dance, 
in vector flight.

CHUNK and split, 
the words align,
Word2Vec, 
connections bind.

Cosine measures, 
similarity’s breath,
query seeks, 
from life to death.

Feedback flows, 
increase, decrease,
corpus shifts, 
adjusts, 
finds peace.

OpenAI, 
context grows,
phrases bloom, 
as shadow sows.

In this dance, 
the dark and light,
fear and code, 
merge in night.
